		one-to-one
		one-to-many
		many-to-many
		
		There are three types of relationships: One-to-one: Both tables can have
		 only one record on either side of the relationship. Each primary key value
		  relates to only one (or no) record in the related table. ... Many-to-many:
		   Each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records)
		    in the other table.
