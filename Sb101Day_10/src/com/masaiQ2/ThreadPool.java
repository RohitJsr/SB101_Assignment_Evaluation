  	Java Thread Pool
Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reused many times.

In the case of a thread pool, a group of fixed-size threads is created. A thread from the thread pool is 
ulled out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job, the thread is contained 
in the thread pool again.

Example of Java Thread Pool
Let's see a simple example of the Java thread pool using ExecutorService and Executors.

File: WorkerThread.java

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;  
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;  
class WorkerThread implements Runnable {  
    private String message;  
    public WorkerThread(String s){  
        this.message=s;  
    }  
     public void run() {  
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" (Start) message = "+message);  
        processmessage();//call processmessage method that sleeps the thread for 2 seconds  
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" (End)");//prints thread name  
    }  
    private void processmessage() {  
        try {  Thread.sleep(2000);  } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }  
    }  
}  



public class TestThreadPool {  
     public static void main(String[] args) {  
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);//creating a pool of 5 threads  
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  
            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread("" + i);  
            executor.execute(worker);//calling execute method of ExecutorService  
          }  
        executor.shutdown();  
        while (!executor.isTerminated()) {   }  
  
        System.out.println("Finished all threads");  
    }  
 }  
 
 
 
 Callable interface and Runnable interface are used to encapsulate tasks supposed to be executed by another thread.

However, Runnable instances can be run by Thread class as well as ExecutorService but Callable instances can only be 
executed via ExecutorService.
