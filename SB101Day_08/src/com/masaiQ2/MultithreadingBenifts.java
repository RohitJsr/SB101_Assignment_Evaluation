/*
What are the benefits of using Multithreading?


There are various benefits of multithreading as given below:

Allow the program to run continuously even if a part of it is blocked. 
Improve performance as compared to traditional parallel programs that use multiple processes. 
Allows to write effective programs that utilize maximum CPU time
Improves the responsiveness of complex applications or programs. 
Increase use of CPU resources and reduce costs of maintenance. 
Saves time and parallelism tasks. 
If an exception occurs in a single thread, it will not affect other threads as threads are independent. 
Less resource-intensive than executing multiple processes at the same time.
