	 Q3) Differentiate between process and thread.

		Thread: It simply refers to the smallest units of the particular process. 
		It has the ability to execute different parts (referred to as thread) of
		 the program at the same time.
		 
	    Process: It simply refers to a program that is in execution i.e., an active program.
	     A process can be handled using PCB (Process Control Block). 


	Thread:
	1.It is a subset of a subunit of a process.	
	2.These are easier to create, lightweight, and have less overhead. 	
	3.Processes with multiple threads use fewer resources.	
	
	Process:
	1.It is a program in execution containing multiple threads.
	2.These are difficult to create, heavyweight, and have more overhead.
	3.Processes without threads use more resources.
