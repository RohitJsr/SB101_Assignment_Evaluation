	 Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?

Multithreading means multiple threads and is considered one of the 
most important features of Java. As the name suggests, it is the 
ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads independently at the
 same time but share the process resources simultaneously. Its
  main purpose is to provide simultaneous execution of multiple 
  threads to utilize the CPU time as much as possible. It is a Java 
  feature where one can subdivide the specific program into two or more 
  threads to make the execution of the program fast and easy.
